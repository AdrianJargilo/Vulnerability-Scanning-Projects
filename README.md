# Vulnerability Scanning Projects

This repository contains vulnerability scanning projects using **GreenBone (OpenVAS)** and **Nessus Expert**. The aim of these projects is to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities in system configurations.

## Tools Used
- **GreenBone (formerly OpenVAS)**: Open-source vulnerability scanner that helps detect weaknesses in network systems.
- **Nessus Expert**: A commercial vulnerability scanner widely used in organizations for regular security audits.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Vulnerability Scanning with GreenBone (OpenVAS)

- **Target**: Metasploitable virtual machine (IP: 10.10.10.10)
- **Report**: [View OpenVAS Vulnerability Report](./OpenVAS_Scanning_Report.pdf)

- **Key Findings**: 
    - Backdoor detected (Bind Shell)
    - Weak encryption protocols (SSL 2.0/3.0)
    - Outdated Unix system version
    - Default weak passwords in VNC
    - SSL Self-signed certificate

### 2. Vulnerability Scanning with Nessus Expert

- **Key Findings**:
    - Critical backdoor detected
    - Deprecated encryption protocols (SSL 2.0/3.0)
    - Weak random number generator in OpenSSL
    - VNC using default password

## Conclusion
Both scanners identified significant vulnerabilities, such as weak encryption protocols, outdated system versions, and insecure configurations. Recommendations were made to patch these issues, and further hardening of the systems was implemented.
